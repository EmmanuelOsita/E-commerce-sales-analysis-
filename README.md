### Key Low Metrics on customerâ€™s data base to improve sales, customer retention and operational efficiency

## Introduction
This report outlines the process and insights derived from an e-commerce store sales analysis I carried out as a simulated hired Data Analyst.The purpose of the project is to help improve sales, customer retention and operational efficiency and as a hired data analyst my task is use the customers data base and analyze their historical data, uncover trends and provide recommendations for strategic improvements.

## Problem Statement

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repository
- **Task_4_ecommerce_data_internpulse.ipynb** â†’ Jupyter Notebook for data analysis.
- **dataset_for_ecommerce.xlsx** â†’ The dataset used for analysis.

## Objectives
1. Sales Trends Analysis
a. Identify historical sales trends (e.g., monthly, seasonal, or annual patterns).
b. Highlight the top-performing product categories and assess their contribution to overall revenue.

2. Customer Retention and Loyalty
a. Calculate the customer retention rate and identify the percentage of returning customers.

3. Geographical Performance
a. Pinpoint regions with high and low sales performance.

## Methodology
This project was conducted using Excel and Python, with data sourced from an e-commerce store. The methodology followed a systematic approach that involved several key steps:

Data cleaning: The data was first cleaned using Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy by addressing missing values, correcting data inconsistencies and standardizing entries.
Data transformation: key variables were transformed to make the data suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, I explored trends in customers, examine customers retention and operational efficiency in other to improve the sales of the business.

Advanced Analysis: I conducted more advanced analysis including predicting outcomes, uncovering trends and patterns, and also operational efficiency using Python
Dashboard Creation: I created an interactive dashboard in Python using matploylib.pylot and seaborn libraries.

## Analysis
